------

A database model is the logical structure of a database that determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated.  The underlaying data model of a database can be broken three components:

**1. Structures**
- e.g. Rows and Columns, nodes and edges, key-value pairs

**2. Constraints**
- e.g. all rows must have same number of cloumns, child cannot have two parents, a class of values must be of a certain type

**3. Operations**
- e.g. find the value of a key, find the rows where condition x is met, get the next N bytes of data

Common types of database models include:
- Relational model
- Hierarchical database model
- Network model
- Object model
- Document model
